It is my Python / Django study project. 

This blog web application allows users to create and manage their own accounts, create blog posts, upload images, and interact with other authors posts on the platform. Users can easily register for a new account, or log in to their existing account to access the dashboard. From there, they can create new posts and upload images to accompany them.

The dashboard also allows users to view and manage their existing posts, including editing or deleting them as needed. Users can also browse and read posts from other authors on the platform.

The blog application is built using the Python programming language and the Django web framework, providing a robust and scalable platform for users to share their thoughts and ideas.
